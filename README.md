# Install Guide
Ensure that the operating system you are on can use python in terminal, and supports sqlite3. This includes, but is not limited to Linux, Windows, and macOS. Find the coalMiners' repository, click the green "code" button, and then the "SSH" button. Copy and paste the password-protected SSH, open terminal or your system's equivalent, and type in "git clone __KEY__". You should get the coalMiners folder within your current directory. It will contain the tools needed to launch the program.

# Launch Codes

Ensure that you have a method to run Flask. If you do not, here is how to do it:
python -m venv ~/pyVM
cd ~/pyVM/
. bin/activate
pip install flask
Now navigate to the location you cloned your coalMiners repository to. You can now
python3 __init__.py
to run.
