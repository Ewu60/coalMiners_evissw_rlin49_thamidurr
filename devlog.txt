INITIAL DD REVIEW - - 2025-10-23 11:25\n
- Link CSS to html in the diagram
- Use format for structured database
- Our maps are clear and our navbar is intuitive
- individual pages should have access to login/logout and the user should be able to browse the pages without logging in
- Removed profile from our users database
